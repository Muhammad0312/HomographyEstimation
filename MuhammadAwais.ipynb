    "## Initial thoughts  \n",
    "These were my initial thoughts as saw the problem.  \n",
    "Motion between two monocular images can be described by either a fundamental matrix or a homography.  \n",
    "Fundamental matrix is better when the scene is non planar.  \n",
    "Homography is better when the scene is planar.  \n",
    "Since the drone is at an altitude of 119m, the scene can reasonably be assumed to be planar.  \n",
    "Also satellite imagery is taken at a very high altitude, it can also be assumed to be planar.  \n",
    "I would have to compute keypoints between images, match them, compute the homography and decompose  \n",
    "it to get the motion between two scenes."

    "# First approach\n",
    "Generally, I approach a problem starting forom ground up  \n",
    "So I collected some data from google earth which was simpler as compared to the given task  \n",
    "I then setup the pipeline using SIFT  \n",
    "It worked and i was able to get good stiching between images.  \n",
    "But it didn't work for the given frames which i already suspected.  \n",
    "SIFT while being invariant to scale and rotations, is not very robust against illumination changes.  \n",
    "Both images had keypoints, but there were not enough good matches to compute a good homography.  \n",
    "This resulted in a poor stitching if not a stitching at all.  \n",
    "I tried the same pipeline with ORB and AKAZE as well.  \n",
    "I didn't include this pipeline in the notebook.  \n",
    "# Second approach\n",
    "The next approach was to look for a feature descriptor which is robust against illumination changes  \n",
    "and provides descriptors which are kind of time invariant.  \n",
    "After reviewing some literature, I chose SuperPoint as the keypoint detector and descriptor and SuperGlue as the matching algorithm.  \n",
    "Below is my implementation of a basic visual navigation system. Comments are added where deemed necessary.   "
